\chapter{Introduction}

Fermat's Last Theorem is the statement that if $a,b,c,n$ are positive whole numbers with $n\geq 3$, then $a^n+b^n\not=c^n$. It is thus a statement about a family of \emph{Diophantine equations} ($a^3+b^3=c^3, a^4+b^4=c^4,\ldots$). Diophantus was a Greek mathematician who lived around 1800 years ago, and he would have been able to understand the statement of the theorem (he knew about positive integers, addition and multiplication).
